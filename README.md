# ToWatch-React

This is React application where you can create your personalized collection of videos from different websites that you love or want to watch later. Unlike traditional bookmarks that can be messy and easy to forget, our site provides a clean and organized way to keep track of your favorite content. Our platform allows you to:
Create your video collection: Gather videos form any website like YouTube, Vimeo, TikTok and many more.
Share your favorite videos: Share with friends or keep them private
Watch later: Mark videos you want to come back to.
This platform is perfect for anyone who loves watching videos but wants a better, more organized way to keep track of them. âœ¨
