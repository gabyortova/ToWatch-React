# ToWatch-React
My React project

1. In the client folder: npm install
2. Run mongoDB server on localhost:27017
3. Run the server (in the server2 folder): node index.js (starts on port 5100)
4. Run client (in the client folder): npm run dev
(The client must be launched at http://localhost:5173 for the back-end to work)
